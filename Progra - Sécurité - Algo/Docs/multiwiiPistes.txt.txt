...- If a ACC is present (Nunchuk or other I2C), you won't be able to arm the motors until you do a proper ACC calibration manually.
If the calibration is not done or if the multi is too much inclinated, the status LED will slowly blink every 1s....

..new optional arming procedure via an AUX switch
this option is activated only if at least one checkbox is checked on the line "ARM"
the motors won't arm if the copter is plugged while the tx switch is in the armed position.
you must use the switch to disarm position then back to arm position in order to arm the motors...

...Another 'feature' worth mentioning is that changes in the switch position are only
acknowledged when the throttle stick is all the way down.
This prevents accidentally arming the motors at mid or full throttle.
One downside is that the motors will not disarm unless the throttle stick is all the way down....


MAIN SOFT: new calibration procedure

    The ACC calibration differs now from the gyro calibration.
    gyro calibration: it's still done at each power on. It's also possible manually as before: min throttle+full pitch
    backward+full yaw left.
    acc calibration: motor disarmed, full throttle up, full pitch backward+full yaw left.
